# EXTEND
EMR Numerical Data Extraction Tool

The "EXTEND" tool, short for "Extraction of EMR Numerical Data," offers a flexible natural language processing (NLP) solution tailored for the precise extraction of clinical numeric parameters. Continuously enriching its dictionary and incorporating new rules, EXTEND can be readily adapted to capture additional numerical data crucial for clinical outcomes research.

I now developed an interface to better haddling setting up parameters, monitoring the processes.

Set up a system environment variable named "ENTEND_HOME" and assign the desired path of the EXTEND main folder as its value.
